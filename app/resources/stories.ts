*Anonymous, 24, Final Year Student at INES Ruhengeri*

I never thought I'd deal with depression. I'm the kind of guy who always laughs with people, always keeps it moving. But somewhere between deadlines, noisy roommates in the ghetto, and pressure from all sides — something cracked.

## When Normal Got Too Heavy

In my third year, I started skipping lectures. I wasn’t partying or being lazy. I just couldn’t concentrate anymore. Even reading a paragraph was too much. Nights became longer, sleep became rare, and I felt like I was running on fumes. I would stay silent around people, but inside I was screaming.

## Realizing Something Was Wrong

One day, after failing to present in class because I froze, I overheard a classmate saying, “He’s falling off hard.” That hit me. I knew I needed help, but didn’t know where to begin. Therapy felt out of reach. So I started researching ways to understand what was going on inside me.

## How This Platform Could Have Helped

If **Safe Haven** had been around then, it could’ve changed everything. Here's how:
- **Journaling privately** would’ve helped me release what I couldn't say to anyone.
- The **mood tracker** could've shown me that this wasn’t "just stress" — it was a pattern.
- **Real stories** from other students would've reminded me I’m not alone.
- Watching my **mind garden grow** as I took small steps like logging moods or writing would’ve encouraged me to keep going.

## Why Platforms Like This Matter

We don’t talk about mental health at INES — not really. Most people are scared to say they’re struggling. This platform gives us quiet tools to heal in private. And that’s powerful.

> “Sometimes, we need a place that listens, even if no one else does. That’s what Safe Haven feels like.”

## Where I Am Now

I'm still on my journey. I journal more now. I track my moods. I understand myself better. And I know when it's time to rest.

To anyone going through it — your mind matters. You’re not weak. You’re just carrying more than most can see.`,

Final year was supposed to be my victory lap. Instead, it was the year everything crumbled. I couldn’t focus. I couldn’t sleep. I was either overworking or doing nothing. 

## When Burnout Became Breakdown

Assignments piled up. Group projects stressed me out. Every time I opened my laptop, my chest tightened. I started avoiding classes. My eating habits fell apart, and I kept telling myself, “Just get to graduation.” But each day felt heavier.

## A Cry for Help

One night I broke down crying on a WhatsApp call with my best friend. He told me, “You need help, man. This isn’t just stress.”

The next morning, I booked a session with my university’s counseling center. It was the best decision I made that year.

## What Helped Me Heal

### 1. Understanding Burnout
I wasn’t lazy. I was emotionally and mentally drained. My counselor helped me realize:
- I tied my identity to productivity
- I ignored warning signs: headaches, irritability, detachment
- I hadn’t taken a real break in 3 years

### 2. Rebuilding Balance
I created a routine that prioritized rest *and* focus:
- Morning walks without my phone
- 90-minute focused work blocks, followed by 30-minute breaks
- “No Study” Sundays

### 3. Peer Support
I joined a student mental health group. Hearing others talk about their struggles made me feel less alone.

### 4. Reconnecting with Passion
I picked up drawing again—something I hadn’t done since high school. It wasn’t about being good. It gave me joy.

## Where I Am Now

I’m finishing my degree, but on my terms. I’ve dropped the need to prove myself constantly. My goals shifted:
- Health first
- Purpose second
- Grades third

If you’re a student struggling, know this: You’re not broken. You’re human. Ask for help. Life gets better when you stop carrying it all alone.`,

*Jayden, 25, Freelance Videographer from Kigali*

On the outside, I had a cool life. Creative gigs, social media highlights, and good vibes. But behind the scenes, I was anxious, lonely, and exhausted.

## Hiding in Plain Sight

I said "I'm good" so much that I started believing the lie. But I wasn’t. I couldn’t sleep. I dreaded mornings. I ghosted friends and canceled gigs because I didn’t want to get out of bed.

## The Mirror Moment

One night I stared at myself in the bathroom mirror after another fake-smile Instagram story and thought: “I don’t even recognize you.”

That was my wake-up call.

## What I Did to Change

### 1. I Deleted Instagram for 3 Months
No one needed to know what I was doing. I needed space to exist without performing.

### 2. I Started Journaling (For Real)
I began each morning by writing:
- “What am I feeling?”
- “What do I need today?”
- “What’s one thing I can do that’s kind to myself?”

It was awkward at first, but freeing over time.

### 3. I Opened Up to My Brother
Telling someone I trusted what was really going on lifted a weight I didn’t know I was carrying. He didn’t judge—he just listened. That was enough.

### 4. Therapy Helped Me Rebuild
I found a therapist online who specialized in creative burnout and anxiety. We talked weekly, and I learned:
- My self-worth doesn’t depend on hustle
- It’s okay to not be okay
- Self-respect starts with boundaries

## Today, I’m Not “Fixed”—But I’m Honest

I still have tough days, but now I:
- Don’t pretend I’m fine when I’m not
- Take mental health breaks without guilt
- Talk to friends with depth, not just updates

If you’re in a dark place, know this: You don’t have to pretend. Find one person. Say one real thing. That’s how healing starts.`,
